Mike Bostock : interview-290346
Drives a similar car to the description.

Is a SkyMiles, TCPL, Museum of Bash History, and AAA member.

Bostock is 6' 4", easily tall enough to match the camera footage.

However, upon questioning, Bostock can prove that he was out of town on the morning of the murder, multiple witnesses and credit card transactions confirm.

Should not be considered a suspect, has no SkyMiles membership and has never been a member of the Museum of Bash History.

Jeremy Bowers : interview-9620713
Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.

After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.

Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.
